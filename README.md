Some interesting facts about Pi

* `Piballs.nb` : A funny, not optimal, but still crazy way to compute digits of π. The basic idea is to count the number of collisions in a classical one-dimensional system of two massive balls and an infinite massive wall with very specific initial data. The mathematical treatment of the problem and the reason why π appears was addressed in [reference](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf). Here, we just play with the idea.
